# UnityLibrary
All kinds of scripts, snippets &amp; shaders (mainly collected from forum/answers posts)

### Getting access
- PM me your github id in [unity forums](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/mgear.22727/) or by [email](http://i1.wp.com/unitycoder.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/mail.jpg), so i'll add you into this organization.

### Instructions
- (to be added)
- Not all code has to be working/error-free, the idea is to keep also old code here and then update to newer unity versions when needed
- Some kind of category folders need to be created also, for starters it could be
- Scripts/
- Editor/ (for editor scripts)
- Shaders/
And then have subfolders, like Shaders/Water/..
