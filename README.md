# UnityLibrary
All kinds of scripts, snippets &amp; shaders (mainly collected from forum/answers posts)

### Getting access
- PM me your github id in [unity forums](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/mgear.22727/) or by [email](http://i1.wp.com/unitycoder.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/mail.jpg), so i'll add you into this organization.

### TODO / Instructions
- (To Be Added)
- Not all code has to be working/error-free, the idea is to keep also old code here and then update to newer unity versions when needed
- Scripts/
- Editor/ (for editor scripts)
- Shaders/
And then have specific subfolders, like Shaders/Water/..

### Feedback
- Feel free to post ideas/comments in the issues section https://github.com/UnityCommunity/UnityLibrary/issues
